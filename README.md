### **Part B – Live Demonstration (1 hr)**

**Tools to Use:**

* [ChatGPT Free](https://chat.openai.com)
* [Canva Free](https://canva.com)

**Demos:**

1. **ChatGPT**

   * Generate a paragraph: *"Explain blockchain in simple words for school students."*
   * Summarize a news article.
   * Create a SQL query to fetch top 5 students by marks.

2. **Canva AI**

   * Generate a simple poster with text prompt: *"Create a tech conference poster with modern design and blue theme."*

### **Part C – Prompt Engineering (30 min)**

**Definition:**

* A “prompt” is the set of instructions you give to an AI tool.

**Types of Prompts:**

1. **Informative Prompt** – *"Explain cloud computing with examples."*
2. **Instructive Prompt** – *"Write a 200-word essay on the impact of AI in education."*
3. **Conversational Prompt** – *"What’s your opinion on using AI for student exams?"*

---

**Zero-Shot Prompting** – No example given.
Example: *"Write a 3-line poem about computers."*

**Few-Shot Prompting** – Provide examples.
Example:

> Example 1: "AI is like a brain that never sleeps."
> Example 2: "AI is a mirror reflecting our thoughts."
> Now write a similar 3-line poem about the internet.

### **Part D – Student Activity (1 hr 15 min)**

**Task 1 – Resume Creation with AI**

* Prompt: *"Create a professional MCA student resume with skills in Java, Python, and Cloud Computing. Include education, skills, and projects."*

**Task 2 – Research Summary**

* Find a short AI-related article online, paste it into ChatGPT, and prompt:
  *"Summarize this article in 5 bullet points for MCA students."*

**Task 3 – MCA Project Ideas**

* Prompt: *"Suggest 10 MCA final year project ideas using AI and Cloud Computing."*
